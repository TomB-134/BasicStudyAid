# BasicStudyAid
A simple study aid that will ask for a definition of a term in a command line. 
Has simple statistic tracking.

Currently definitions and terms are hard coded, eventually I'll make it read from a file.

This is essentially a memory exercise that allows me to blast through 100s of terms in 30 minutes since that's how I learn best.
